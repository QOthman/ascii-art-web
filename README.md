## Algorithm Description for ASCII Art Generation

1. **Input Handling:**
   - User submits text and selects one of three font styles via an HTML form.
   - The server parses the form data from an HTTP POST request.

2. **Validation:**
   - The server checks for missing text or font style inputs.
   - Validates the selected font style.

3. **ASCII Art Generation:**
   - Loads ASCII patterns for the selected banner.
   - Converts each character of the input text to its corresponding ASCII pattern.
   - Assembles these patterns line by line to form the complete ASCII art.

4. **Template Rendering:**
   - Loads an HTML template for displaying the ASCII art.
   - Inserts the generated ASCII art into the template.
   - Sends the final HTML response to the user’s browser.
